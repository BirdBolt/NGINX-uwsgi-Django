Complying with the principle of least privilege:
  - demote all processes/services to run as nonroot
      e.g uwsgi. set uid:gid to 100:101
  - have groups and for each service/function/process, with privileges
  overlapping/crossing/exclusive where necessary
      e.g gid:app-service being able to read entire app root,
      but only gid:uid:react being able to write to /static/dir/ shared volume
      even though all members of gid:react are members of gid:app-service
